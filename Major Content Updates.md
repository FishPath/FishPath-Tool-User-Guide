# Major FishPath Tool Content Updates

All large changes to FishPath Tool content will be noted here. This list was started in August 2021. Updates before this are not publicly documented.

For a list of specific individual changes or to be able to filter by option or question, [see here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPlUvI6XuvXtYdFk5bpOsG4JR1fdM0D58KO5mBs0fyE/edit?usp=sharing).

Sections that a change affects are listed in parentheses at the beginning:
DC: Data Collection
A: Assessment
MM: Management Measures

## 2022
### January
*(A) January 25*: Length-based options update.
> Updated the length-based options to be more inclusive of varying specific length-based methods. These options are now designed to follow a progression of having limited length data to having a length and catch series, and a full suite of parameters. Options updated listed below. All have minor updates to their description and criteria/caveats. 
> - LB-SPR
> - Length-Only Integrated Models (previous title: LIME)
> - Catch and Length Integrated Models (NEW)
> - Age-structured Integrated Models (previous title: SCAA)

## 2021

### August
*(DC, A, MM) August 18*: Spatial range of fished population questions combined.
> The new question is: 
>   - Is the range or spatial extent of the fished population greater than the area in which fishing or sampling occurs, or the jurisdictional management boundary?
> 
> The old questions were:
>   - Is the range or spatial extent of the fished population greater than the area in which fishing or sampling occurs?
>   - Do the jurisdictional management boundaries match with the fish stock boundaries?

*(DC, A, MM) August 17*: Life history strategy questions have been combined into one question. 

> The new question is: 
>   - Categorise the life-history strategy of the species of interest.
> 
> The old questions were:
>   - Is the target species slow-growing and long-lived?
>   - Does the species follow a spasmodic population cycle?
>   - Do you have a basic understanding of the general life-history strategy of the species? (E.g., whether it is fast-growing, highly-productive, and short-lived, or if it is slow-growing, slow to mature, and long-lived?)

*(DC, A, MM) August 9*: Added additional answer to "Does the species aggregate?" question. Previously the answers were "No" / "Yes". Now they are "No" / "Yes, and actively targeted while aggregated" / "Yes, but not actively targeted while aggregated".
