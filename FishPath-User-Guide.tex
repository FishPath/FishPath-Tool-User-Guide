\section{Motivation for Developing the FishPath Tool and FishPath
Process}\label{motivation}}

Sustainable fisheries management tends to be underpinned by harvest
strategies that specify a predefined relationship among data collection
programs, assessment methods, and management measures. However, only a
small fraction of the world's fisheries has these management systems in
place, with resource- and data-limited fisheries facing significant
challenges in their development. Notable recent progress has been
achieved in the development of stock assessments and other data-limited
tools, but outstanding challenges for data-limited fisheries lie in
developing fully articulated harvest strategies, which includes
determining, linking, and implementing appropriate options.
Understanding the full suite of available data collection, stock
assessment, and management measure options and choosing the options most
appropriate for each fishery is an often-daunting process, given the
full landscape of options. Exacerbating the challenge of numerous
options, data-limited fisheries are often simultaneously
capacity-limited. In addition, small-scale fisheries have unique
characteristics and challenges, requiring unique and tailored plans, and
where ``silver bullet'' approaches that do not fully consider the entire
fishery's unique challenges must be avoided. An enormous challenge lies
in making fisheries technical information, resources, and harvest
strategy support tools accessible, simple, and structured, while not
oversimplifying the innate complexity and nuanced aspects of each
individual fishery setting as to the detriment of the fishery and
fishery participants.

FishPath was developed as a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy
(TNC), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation (CSIRO). FishPath is an approach for setting fisheries on
the path to sustainability. The FishPath approach is something that
everyone working in fisheries tries to do anyway --- try and figure out
what to do with what you have. It is simply a highly organized and
inclusive way to do it and should be the entry point of any fisheries
management development.

FishPath includes a stakeholder engagement process which is underpinned
by the FishPath tool. The FishPath process aims to engage stakeholders
and build capacity to develop predefined fisheries harvest strategies
that are tailored to local conditions and challenges. The FishPath tool
supports the process of narrowing down and identifying viable components
of the management strategy. However, the FishPath tool, while providing
advice on narrowing the viable list of harvest strategy options, does
not make the final selection or articulate the details of, evaluate, and
implement the harvest strategy. It is strongly encouraged that users
work with trained facilitators from the FishPath Coaches Network to
facilitate this process and use resources found within the FishPath tool
that identify appropriate tools for carrying out the harvest strategy.

\hypertarget{fishpath-tool-overview}{%
\section{FishPath Tool Overview}\label{fishpath-tool-overview}}

The FishPath tool is an online decision-support tool that streamlines
the process for identifying options for the 3 central components of a
harvest strategy, specifically, the appropriate options for data
collection programs, stock assessments, and management measures (or
harvest control rules).

To do this, FishPath tool users answer a series of multiple-choice
questions regarding social, economic, operational, biological,
ecological and governance characteristics of the fishery, including
available data. User responses then flag key assumptions,
considerations, and cautions for each option contained in the FishPath
tool, which provides customized advice on the appropriateness of any
option for the fishery of interest. The results section provides a
guided process for narrowing down available options to a short list to
be more formally considered for inclusion in a harvest strategy
(@ref(fig:overview)). Users can also learn about each option through
details, resources and links within the tool.

It is important to understand what the FishPath tool does and does not
do. First, the FishPath tool is not quantitative -- it does not input,
upload, or analyze data. The FishPath tool does not use an underlying
model and is not a simulation or stock assessment tool. The FishPath
tool does aid in the process of identifying a short list of viable
options, but it does not prescribe a single, preferred option for each
harvest strategy component. Rather, it encourages critical evaluation of
an identified subset of options. The FishPath tool provides a
standardized, transparent, and efficient platform for users to build the
foundation of a harvest strategy for data-limited fisheries. The
FishPath tool content undergoes continual updates to include the latest
fisheries science and practitioner information. FishPath tool users may
submit content suggestions at
\href{mailto:support@fishpath.org}{\nolinkurl{support@fishpath.org}}.

\section{Purpose and Intended Audience of the FishPath Tool User
Guide}\label{purpose-and-intended-audience-of-the-fishpath-tool-user-guide}}

The purpose of the FishPath Tool User Guide is to orient users to the
FishPath tool, explain the functionality of tool features, and provide
succinct guidance on applying the tool to different fishery contexts.
The FishPath Tool User Guide is for fishery practitioners interested in
using the FishPath tool to select and review appropriate harvest
strategy options. The ultimate goal is to embed the fully articulated
harvest strategy within a Fishery Management Plan (outside the scope of
the FishPath Tool User Guide).

The FishPath tool is applicable in a variety of settings. Examples range
from a large, inclusive FishPath stakeholder engagement where the tool
is used in a multi-stakeholder setting, small expert groups, individual
(``desktop'') use for harvest strategy development or review, and
research related to individual components of a harvest strategy, such as
selection of an assessment method or details about specific data
collection or management measure options. The impact of the tool greatly
depends on the context it is used, being most effective in a
multi-stakeholder process and lead by experienced practitioners. The use
of the tool can also be adapted to work with multi-species fisheries,
multi-fleet fisheries, and in selecting current and future scenarios.
Guidance on using the tool in these contexts will be incorporated into
future versions of the user guide.

\hypertarget{starting-the-fishpath-tool}{%
\chapter{Starting the FishPath Tool}\label{starting-the-fishpath-tool}}

Importantly, the FishPath tool requires a consistent internet connection
to access the questionnaire, save answers, and interact with results.

\hypertarget{welcome-page}{%
\section{Welcome Page}\label{welcome-page}}

When a user navigates to \url{https://fishpath.org/} , a welcome page is
displayed with two prompts: ``Create an Account'' or ``Login''
(@ref(fig:welcome)).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/welcome-page}

\caption{Welcome page of the FishPath tool.}\label{fig:welcome}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{creating-a-fishpath-account}{%
\section{Creating a FishPath
Account}\label{creating-a-fishpath-account}}

Upon selecting ``Create an Account'', a pop-up window appears with the
following fill-in fields (@ref(fig:create-account)). An asterisk denotes
mandatory information.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Email*
\item
  Password* (create a password)
\item
  Organization Type*
\item
  Organization
\item
  Your Name*
\item
  Country*
\end{itemize}

Note that the email and password fields are case sensitive.

This information is used to track user origin and the use of the
FishPath tool by diverse organizations. At this account creation stage,
the user is also prompted to read and accept the Terms of Service of the
FishPath tool, developed by the Conservancy
(\protect\hyperlink{terms}{Appendix B}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/create-account} 

}

\caption{“Create an Account” screen of the FishPath tool.}\label{fig:create-account}
\end{figure}

After reading and accepting the Terms of Service, the user will be
directed to their FishPath Tool Dashboard page. The user will receive a
confirmation email of account creation. After account creation, whenever
the user returns to the Welcome Page of the FishPath tool, the user may
simply ``Login'' with their email address and password
(@ref(fig:login-page)).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/login-page}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{fishpath-tool-dashboard}{%
\section{FishPath Tool Dashboard}\label{fishpath-tool-dashboard}}

After creating an account (new user) or logging in (existing user), the
user is directed to the FishPath Tool Dashboard (Fig. 5), or the user's
``homepage'' of the FishPath Tool. On the FishPath Tool Dashboard, users
view 4 headings:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{``FishPath Tool User Guide''}, which contains detail on using
  the FishPath Tool and interpreting results.
\item
  \textbf{``My Fisheries''}, which provides a list of the user's current
  list of fisheries they have started or completed in the tool. Users
  may access their fisheries at any time through this section, and
  return to in-progress FishPath questionnaires or results pages;
\item
  \textbf{``Reference Materials''}, which provides a list of all options
  contained in the FishPath tool with details and reference materials;
\item
  \textbf{``Help us improve the FishPath Tool''}, which allows the user
  to send feedback to the FishPath team.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\emph{\textless TODO: Get updated screenshot (see comment in
word doc for details)\textgreater{}}}

When a user clicks the ``FishPath Tool'' menu in the top left corner, a
drop-down display allows the user to navigate to various options
(Fig.5). The ``Reference Materials'' tab displays all of the options
contained in the FishPath Tool.

\hypertarget{adding-a-new-fishery}{%
\section{Adding a New Fishery}\label{adding-a-new-fishery}}

Selecting the blue button ``Add a Fishery'' allows users to start a new
fishery in the FishPath tool that will be added to their account. First,
a pop-up ``Fishery Information'' screen appears to prompt users to
define the fishery of focus (@ref(fig:fishery-info)), using the fields
below. This information is used to better understand the use of the
FishPath tool, provide high-level aggregate information about fishery
characteristics, and to help users define the fishery to which they will
be applying FishPath, so that answers will be directed at that fishery
only. Multi-species, multi-fleet and other more complicated fisheries
can require special consideration when approaching the questionnaire.
Guidance will be added to this document at a later date.

\begin{itemize}

Upon selecting ``Submit'', the user is prompted to select one of the 3
harvest strategy components (sections) of the FishPath Tool (Data
Collection, Assessment, Management Measures) and begin the FishPath tool
questionnaire (@ref(fig:fishery-entry)). Users can complete and review
results from these sections independently. A pencil in the upper-right
corner allows users to edit the fishery information (input in
@ref(fig:fishery-entry)) at any time.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{fishpath-tool-questionnaire}{%
\chapter{FishPath Tool
Questionnaire}\label{fishpath-tool-questionnaire}}

The goal of the FishPath tool questionnaire is to elicit information
about all aspects of the fishery. This information leads to the
activation of assumptions, cautions and considerations for each option.
Across the three sections (Data Collection, Assessment, and Management
Measures) the user answers a series of \textasciitilde110 questions.
Questions are categorized in 6 categories, which indicate the nature of
the information in the question:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Biology/Life History
\item
  Data Availability
\item
  Governance
\item
  Management
\item
  Operational Characteristics
\item
  Socio-Economic
\end{enumerate}

Some questions span multiple sections of the questionnaire (i.e.~they
are relevant in considering multiple components of a harvest strategy).
To avoid duplicity, such questions, once answered, will show as
completed when beginning any subsequent section in which they occur.

At any time, the user may close and later return to their session via
their ``My Fisheries'' dashboard. Any submitted answers will be saved
with a consistent internet connection. Once the user has completed an
individual section, which may only be achieved by providing responses to
all questions in that section, the user may either complete a subsequent
section or view results from the completed section. Results for any
section become available once the user has completed the respective
questionnaire. The questionnaire is periodically updated by the FishPath
team to reflect the latest fisheries science, so users may need to
answer any new questions when returning to a fishery before reviewing
results of associated sections.

After viewing the entry screen to the FishPath questionnaire
(@ref(fig:fishery-entry)), the user selects one of the 3 sections. An
overview screen will appear with the name of the section, the number of
questions associated with that section, and a short guidance on
answering the questions (@ref(fig:dc-overview)). The user can then
choose to ``Begin'' the section or ``Choose Another Section''.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/dc-overview}

\caption{Data Collection section overview.}\label{fig:dc-overview}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{criteria-and-caveat-questions}{%
\section{Criteria and Caveat
Questions}\label{criteria-and-caveat-questions}}

In the FishPath tool, questions are designated as either ``Criteria'' or
``Caveats'' or both, which refers to how question responses are linked
to options contained within FishPath.

A Criterion question is used to determine whether the fishery meets a
minimum qualification required to apply an option. Whether the fishery
meets the minimum (or often multiple) criteria for each option is
indicated in the results window (see Results sections below). For
example, in the ``Assessment'' section of the questionnaire, there are
questions about data quality, quantity, and data type for the fishery,
which correspond to the minimum levels required to enable each type of
assessment method. Upon answering a ``criteria question'' about, for
example, fishing effort data, within the Assessment section
(@ref(fig:ex-crit-question)), the fishery will be scored in the results
section according to whether it meets that particular minimum level of
effort data required by particular assessment options. The Results
section reports not only whether or not each criterion is met, but also
gives an indication, via subjectively assigned traffic light color
scales, as to the degree the criteria is met, and provides guidance as
to the level of uncertainty associated with that particular required
input. Criteria questions are not included in the ``Management
Measures'' section. While a management measure option may be ill-advised
because it violates assumptions (i.e, ``caveats''), there are no
prohibiting factors that would prevent any single option being
implemented, if so desired. Conversely, one cannot undertake certain
assessments or forms of data collection without meeting minimum
requirements.

Questions whose responses invoke ``caveats'' will not eliminate or
retain options, but rather invoke subjectively assigned traffic
light-colored warnings, or positive attributes, against specific
options. These are intended to speak to issues that do not necessarily
prohibit the option's feasibility, but that should be given explicit
consideration, and the ability to address each should be determined,
before deeming the option is best suited to the fishery. As with the
criteria questions, these are presented in the results section of the
FishPath tool with explanatory text.

\begin{figure}

\hypertarget{anatomy-of-a-fishpath-tool-question}{%
\section{Anatomy of a FishPath Tool
Question}\label{anatomy-of-a-fishpath-tool-question}}

Figure 10 provides an example of a FishPath question screen:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  At the top of the screen , the \textbf{section} is shown (either Data
  Collection, Assessments, or Management Measures).
\item
  The section is followed by the \textbf{question category} (i.e.,
  Biology/Life History, Data Availability, Governance, Management,
  Operational Characteristics, or Socio-Economic).
\item
  A sub-heading identifies whether the question is a
  \textbf{``criteria'' or a ``caveat''} question.
\item
  The sub-heading also indicates the \textbf{number of questions
  answered} and remaining within that section.
\item
  For the Data Collection section only, it is also stated whether the
  question pertains to either issues of \textbf{``representation'' or
  ``implementation''}. This helps users to understand the intent of the
  question, by identifying whether the question has ramifications for
  the form of data collection in terms of its either ability to obtain
  representative data, or in its ability to be effectively implemented.
\item
  There is the ability to \textbf{``Bookmark''} the question A bookmark
  flags questions for ease of later revisiting (Fig 11). A question may
  be bookmarked for reasons such as if the answer is unknown, it needs
  further consideration or input, is in dispute, or if the user feels
  the question is critical. As all questions must be answered in order
  to review results, adding a bookmark allows users to provide an
  interim response that may be revisited in the results section, once
  the user can evaluate the relative impact of their response.
\item
  Users can \textbf{``Take A Note''} on a question (Fig. 11). Notes can
  be taken for a variety of reasons such as to clarify why a certain
  response was given, to capture important discussion had about a
  question, why the question was bookmarked or noting a response
  requiring further research. Notes can later form an important part of
  draft harvest strategy development, and, by providing justification
  for the response, can maintain traceability and replicability. When
  connected to the internet, all notes made will be saved into FishPath
  and available to the user for reference.
\item
  At the bottom of the screen, the user may advance to the \textbf{next
  question} or return to the \textbf{previous} question.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\emph{\textless TODO: ADD NUMBERS TO SCREENSHOT BEFORE INSERTING
FIGS 10 AND 11\textgreater{}}}

\hypertarget{subjective-questions}{%
\section{Subjective Questions}\label{subjective-questions}}

While the majority of questions within FishPath are intended to be
answered definitively (objective), certain questions are subjective in
nature. The latter typically request a user response in the form of a
perceived ranking (e.g.~``low'', ``moderate'', ``high''). Most such
questions invoke caveats and, when all caveats are considered together,
the relative impact of those invoked by subjective questions can be
evaluated. In this way, priority can be assigned to whether the response
requires further consideration and debate, or whether it is of little
relative significance in determining the most viable harvest strategy
options. Further discussion can then be focused on the most appropriate
issues.

Generally, the best approach to take when completing the questionnaire
is to aim to do so relatively efficiently, without overtly laboring or
debating over any one question. If in doubt, the question can be
bookmarked, and notes can be taken, for easy revisiting later. The
transparency of the FishPath tool is such that users will be able to see
explicitly how their response to any one question influences the results
(by invoking criteria or caveats), and to readily change their answer if
so desired . Moreover, the aim of the questionnaire is to obtain an
overall profile of the fishery's characteristics, so as best to inform
the choice of harvest strategy option. As such, questions may pertain to
only a few options, or they may not invoke strong caveats. The goal is
to appraise the fishery as a whole, as opposed to myopically focusing on
any single question.

\hypertarget{completing-the-questionnaire}{%
\section{Completing the
Questionnaire}\label{completing-the-questionnaire}}

Upon completing or exiting any of the three sections, a summary screen
appears with the status of relative completion. Users review their
result for completed sections, or otherwise continue the questionnaire
(@ref(fig:summary-screen)).

\begin{figure}
 
 {\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/summary-screen} 
 
 }
 
 \caption{Summary window of the 3 FishPath questionnaire sections, showing questionnaire progress.}\label{fig:summary-screen}
 \end{figure}

\hypertarget{fishpath-tool-results-overview}{%
\chapter{FishPath Tool Results
Overview}\label{fishpath-tool-results-overview}}

Each of the three sections of the results can be accessed individually
without needing to complete all three sections. If a user has not
completed the questionnaire in at least one of the sections, they will
be prompted to return to finish the section questionnaire before
accessing results (Fig. 12).

\hypertarget{data-collection-section-results}{%
\section{Data Collection Section
Results}\label{data-collection-section-results}}

The Data Collection section allows the user to understand viable
alternate means of collecting information, and the broad type of data
that may be collected. In a harvest strategy context, a data collection
program defines the method and the type of data that will be collected
on the species of interest. The collection of these data is critical for
informing stock status. Fishery data are used to either glean empirical
performance indicators or inform a quantitative assessment.

The FishPath tool covers a range of data collection mechanisms (from
market surveys, to logbooks and observer programs). These data
collection mechanisms are subdivided according to the broad category of
data that may be collected, as these influence the viability of the data
collection option. The four data categories in the FishPath tool are: 1)
biological information; 2) data that yield a basic understanding of the
fishery; 3) data that can inform temporal trend analyses (data time
series), and 4) data that are of a sufficient quality to inform a
model-based stock assessment.

\hypertarget{assessment-section-results}{%
\section{Assessment Section Results}\label{assessment-section-results}}

The Assessment section of the FishPath tool allows the user to
understand which data-limited stock assessment methods are available and
best suited to their fishery. In the FishPath tool, an assessment is
defined as any analysis or performance indicator that gives useful
information for management by direct or indirect measures of stock
status. This could range from a ``cause for concern'' arising from
expert judgement, qualitative risk assessments, values of empirical
indicators relative to pre-defined trigger levels, multiple indicator
frameworks, to life history analyses that provide estimates of fishing
mortality, F, or fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield FMSY,
catch-only models, size or length based approaches, to population
dynamics model-fitting approaches that estimate biomass.

\hypertarget{management-measure-section-results}{%
\section{Management Measure Section
Results}\label{management-measure-section-results}}

A management measure is the form of control used to manage the fishing
mortality. Once the desired management measures have been identified
(for example, size limits, or catch adjustments in response to
quantitative assessment outcomes), they are adjusted via ``decision
rules'', or ``harvest control rules''. These specify the strength and
nature of the pre-agreed management action to be taken given the status
of the fishery, as determined by the assessment. Management measures can
take many forms including spatial, temporal, effort, catch, and gear
related restrictions. The FishPath tool does not have any minimum
criteria listed for management measures, but instead uses cautionary
caveats: while there may circumstances that point to an option being
ill-advised, there are no hard-prohibiting factors, per se, that would
prevent any single option being implemented. Multiple management
measures can and should be used together. The FishPath tool results do
not prescribe or give guidance on the specific form of the harvest rule,
nor the strength of adjustment in response to assessment outcomes.
However, FishPath does direct users to tools that can support in this
process.

\hypertarget{fishpath-tool-interactive-results-page}{%
\chapter{FishPath Tool Interactive Results
Page}\label{fishpath-tool-interactive-results-page}}

Upon completion of the questionnaire for any section, the user is
directed to the FishPath Tool Results Review page (Figure 13). The
results are presented separately for each of the 3 sections, or harvest
strategy component: 1) Data Collection; 2) Assessment; and 3) Management
Measures (Figure 13, shown in dark blue bars near top of screen).

This interactive page has four main components:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Results support tools} to share, export and copy results;
\item
  A \textbf{results table} of all the options contained in FishPath with
  their criteria and caveats;
\item
  \textbf{Questionnaire Summaries} (``Influential Answers'' and ``See
  All Answers'')
\item
  A step-wise \textbf{results narrowing process}.
\end{enumerate}

While the general structure of the results pages is the same across all
three sections, each has unique differences. Here, the results table and
results narrowing process are described in general. This is followed by
sections that describe the details unique to each of the three sections.

\textbf{\textless TODO: UPDATE FIG 13 TO HAVE NUMBERS\textgreater{}}

\hypertarget{results-support-tools}{%

  their active account. A shared fishery can be saved under someone
  else's FishPath account, and they can make a copy of it to separately
  edit, if needed. Tip: when creating a copy of a shared fishery in a
  user account, it is useful to rename the fishery so that edits are
  tracked under this new name.
\item
  \textbf{Export:} This allows users to export the question and answer
  list from the saved questionnaire, as well as a simple results file,
  as a .csv file.
\item
  \textbf{Copy:} This allows users to make a copy of a fishery's
  results, be these their own, or from a shared link. To rename that
  fishery and edit it under a different name, the user should select the
  ``Edit Name and Details'' button.
\item
  \textbf{Edit Name and Details:} This allows users to edit the
  information entered on the Fishery Information form (name, species,
  geography, etc.)
\item
  \textbf{Generate Report:} Allows the user to create a .PDF of the
  FishPath results, with all notes captured. The report provides
  detailed information on each option and their associated caveats and
  criteria related to the fishery. Users can select to see a report for
  the ``full list'' of options, or for a specified list of ``top
  options''. This process of identifying top options is detailed below.

\hypertarget{results-table}{%
\section{Results Table}\label{results-table}}

The results table lists all the available options for the section of
interest in rows. Each row summarizes the criteria met and failed, and
the caveats invoked (see also ``Criteria and Caveat Questions'' section
above). Each option can be selected and expanded to view its description
and results in more detail. A guide to the content contained in each row
is listed below.

\hypertarget{table-structure}{%
\subsection{Table Structure}\label{table-structure}}

@ref(fig:single-row) displays a single row from an example results
table. The single row represents one option in the FishPath tool, and
the details of this singe row are as follows:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/single-row} 

}

\caption{Headings of the FishPath tool results table.}\label{fig:single-row}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hide/Unhide:} Any option for which one or more of its minimum
  criteria have not been met by the fishery is automatically ``hidden''
  (greyed-out) by the FishPath tool. For any option, including those not
  meeting minimum criteria, users may manually click this link to
  ``hide'' the option, or click ``hidden'' or reinstate it.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.1\linewidth]{images/hide} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Notes:} As within the questionnaire, notes may be written and
  saved (with a secure internet connection) for each option. For
  example, notes may be taken on fishery-specific details (not covered
  within the questionnaire) on why that option may or may not be a good
  fit, or to record the user's or user groups overall evaluation of the
  option, given its associated criteria and caveats. Alternatively,
  notes may be taken if options are hidden or reinstated, to justify
  that choice as documentation. Notes are be included in the PDF report.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.15\linewidth]{images/notes} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Criteria (Data Collection and Assessment sections):} The
  criteria column provides information on whether the fishery meets the
  minimum conditions required to undertake the option. As explained
  above, the Management Measures section does not include criteria. If
  the fishery has met all of the minimum criteria required for the
  option, a green check is displayed. On the other hand, if a fishery
  has not met one or more of the minimum criteria required for the
  option, a red X is displayed (and the option is automatically
  ``hidden''). The numbered boxes next to the red ``X'' indicate the
  number of criteria met (green) and unmet (black). For the assessment
  section only, criteria also have associated ``traffic light'' colored
  (black, red, orange, yellow, green) guidance to encourage FishPath
  users to explicitly consider the possible uncertainty associated with
  the quality of their fishery's information (with black equating to a
  minimum criterion not having been met). The numbers within in each
  symbol, are the subset of the total criteria for that option that were
  not met (black), and that invoked (red, orange, yellow) uncertainty
  warnings, and positive attributes (green) , as triggered by
  questionnaire responses.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{images/criteria} \end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Caveats:} The format of the caveats column is identical across
  all three sections. Caveats are shown as colored circles with numbers
  indicating the total number of questionnaire responses that invoked a
  caveat of that particular color. There are three types of caveats:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Cautionary, or warning caveats:} these are marked as red,
    orange, and yellow circles with the severity or strength of the
    caveat corresponding to the color (red being highest). These give
    cautionary guidance based on an attribute of a fishery. For example,
    if the user responded that the species of interest is susceptible to
    barotrauma, this would invoke a red caveat against size limits as a
    management measure, since the fishing-induced mortality of the
    released (under- or over-sized) fish would render size limits
    ineffective.
  \item
    \textbf{Positive attributes:} A green colored caveat provides
    reasoning for why the option might be well-suited for the fishery on
    the basis on a of a user response in the questionnaire.
  \item
    \textbf{Static caveats:} Turquoise colored caveats are static
    caveats that need to be considered for an option, regardless of the
    fishery or the questionnaire responses. A static caveat is
    independent of specific fishery circumstances and as such are always
    present. These include key assessment assumptions, for example, that
    the assessment option assumes that fishery selectivity has not
    changed over time, or that the assessment method cannot explicitly
    address uncertainty.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textless TODO: UPDATE SCREENSHOT WITH NEW
CAVEATS\textgreater{}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{(Data) Category:} The Category column allows the user to view
  the options by categories. This column is different for each section.
  In the Data Collection Section, this column is titled ``Data
  Category'', showing the four categories of the type of data that may
  be collected (see also ``Data Collection Section Results'' above). In
  the Assessment Section, this column is titled either ``Input-Based
  Category'' or ``Output-Based Category'', reflecting two sorting
  options available for organizing the assessment option results. In the
  Management Measures Section, this column is simply titled ``Category''
  and displays the categories of management measures.
\item
  \textbf{Option:} This is the name of the option being considered.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{full-option-details}{%
\subsection{Full Option Details}\label{full-option-details}}

Each row in the Results Table displays the option name with summarized
results for each option. When users click on any option, a pop-up box
appears, which provides full details of the option itself, together with
the detail of the criteria and caveats invoked.

First, a description of the option is provided, together with relevant
references, and contact information (if available or appropriate). For
the Data Collection options, the types of data that may be collected
using the option are summarized. For the Assessment section, where
available, links to assessment packages are provided.

Next, the invoked criteria and caveats are summarized by (Fig. 15)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Criteria not met,
\item
  Met criteria,
\item
  Cautionary caveats,
\item
  Positive attribute caveats, and
\item
  Static caveats
\end{itemize}

Next to each, there are individual drop-down menus where the user can
find the specific detail on each individual criterion and caveat, along
with the question and response that invoked the criterion or caveat.

\textbf{\textless TODO: UPDATE PICTURE WITH NEW CAV ICONS AND MERGE TWO

\textbf{Criteria drop-down box (Figs. 16-17)}: Each criterion drop-down
shows the relevant question with the user's response shown (highlighted
in black) relative to the minimum required level for that option (where
green coloring starts on left) (@ref(fig:crit-drop-down)). The
Assessment section assigns traffic light colors to levels above the
minimum, indicating their relative uncertainty and thus the relative
caution that should be taken (Fig X17 ).

\textbf{Caveat Drop-Down Box (Figs. 18-20)}: Each individual caveat box
displays the FishPath question with the user's answer in grey text,
followed by caveat text related to the use of the option in the fishery
in the context of that particular question response. The color of each
box reflects the caveat color (see caveat descriptions above):
cautionary caveats shaded yellow, orange or red; positive attributes
shaded green; and static caveats shaded in turquoise.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{filters-and-sorting-of-results-table}{%
\subsection{Filters and Sorting of Results
Table}\label{filters-and-sorting-of-results-table}}

The ``Filters and Sorting'' functionality allows the user to arrange and
view the options in different ways. This does not affect the results or
shortlisting of options; it is merely a means to organize and display
the results. All three sections have the same filter and sorting
functions. The Assessment section has an additional option to select
between two categories to sort and display: ``Output-Based Category''
(i.e., according to the general type of output generated by the
assessment method or option); or ``Input-Based Category'' (i.e.,
according to the main form of input required by the assessment or
option).

After clicking ``Filters and Sorting'', a pop-up box
(@ref(fig:filter-and-sorting)) appears with the ability to sort the
options by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Default Order:} The default sort is to list all options that
  did not meet minimum criteria at the bottom (automatically greyed out
  as hidden options), with the options for which the highest number of
  cautionary caveats were invoked at the top for review.
\item
  \textbf{Customized Sort Order:} This maintains the current sort order
  but allows users to return to the results table and ``drag and drop''
  options into the preferred order.
\item
  \textbf{Sort by option name:} Sorts options alphabetically by option
  name.
\item
  \textbf{Sort by category:} Sorts options alphabetically by category
  name. For the Assessment section, users first select the Category
  Display that they want to display and sort by.
\end{itemize}

Clicking a Sort option automatically sorts the options on the screen.
After making selections on the Filters and Sorting page, users can click
outside of the pop-up onto the results table to return to the results.
The ``Show hidden options'' functionality allows users to display or not
display those options that have been ``hidden'' (greyed out) in the
results table.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{summaries-of-questionnaire-responses}{%
\section{Summaries of Questionnaire
Responses}\label{summaries-of-questionnaire-responses}}

If the user scrolls to the bottom of the results screen (below results
table), they are provided with a summary list of the questions
bookmarked by the user, together with a list of ``Influential Answers'',
and, finally, a ``See All Answers'' link.

\hypertarget{flagged-questions}{%
\subsection{Flagged Questions}\label{flagged-questions}}

All questions that were ``bookmarked'' during the questionnaire will be
listed here (Fig. 22 ). Users can select each question to get a detailed
list of all caveats invoked or criteria not met based on the response.
Users can also select each question to change the answer, add notes, or
remove bookmark. It is highly recommended to review these questions and
invoked caveats so that users can update their response or provide more
detailed notes on the response, based on seeing how the response impacts
results.

\textbf{\textless TODO: ADD FIGURE\textgreater{}}

\hypertarget{influential-answers}{%
\subsection{Influential Answers}\label{influential-answers}}

The ``Influential Answers'' list is a summary of the questions and user
responses that invoked the most eliminating criteria (by number),
together with the number of caveats and criteria invoked, by assigned
traffic light color (@ref(fig:influential-answers)). The caveats invoked
by the question are displayed (color strength and number) to its left.

It is recommended to review this list prior to entering the results
narrowing process (described below), to better understand some of the
key challenges facing the fishery. Users can select any question on this
list to change an answer, add notes to the question, and see a list of
all impacted options and their associated caveats (Fig. 24).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/influential-answers} 

}

\caption{List of influential answers}\label{fig:influential-answers}
\end{figure}

\textbf{\textless TODO: ADD FIG 24\textgreater{}}

At the bottom of these lists, there is a link to ``See All Answers'' (as
well as at the top of the results screen under ``Answers''). These links
take users to a full list of answers from each section, showing all
information, including the number of caveats invoked, and any flagged
questions. This is a good resource for users wanting to review the
questionnaire responses for a fishery.

\hypertarget{results-narrowing-process}{%
\section{Results Narrowing Process}\label{results-narrowing-process}}

Typically, the FishPath questionnaire process results in a long list of
potential options that are presented to the user. The challenge is to
then refine this to a workable shortlist of options that can be reviewed
in further detail, and around which a draft harvest strategy can be
developed. This can be a daunting task, given the number of options, and
the large amount of detail around the criteria and caveats invoked
against each. As such, the Results Review provides guidance as to how to
undertake the task of narrowing the list of viable harvest strategy
components.

The Results Narrowing process prompts the user through a series of steps
to further refine and narrow the options for their fishery, and to
consider detail about the application of each option in the fishery. The
goal is to finish with a short list of defensible, appropriate and
documented options for the fishery.

First, the user accesses the Results Narrowing process by selecting the
``Review Top Options'' button located above the Results Table in the
Results Screen.

\textbf{\textless TODO: INSERT FIGURE\textgreater{}}

After clicking on ``Review Top Options'', the user is directed to a
step-wise results review process (@ref(fig:results-review)). Each step
of the results review process contains an ``Instructions'' box with
clear steps, as well as the ability to access different steps of the
results review process through ``Back'', ``Exit Review'' and ``Next
Step'' (@ref(fig:results-review)). Across the top of the page, the user
views steps in the process:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/results-review} 

}

\caption{Overview of the FishPath Tool results screen and results review process.}\label{fig:results-review}
\end{figure}

The Results Narrowing process in the FIshPath tool was developed for use
in a multi-stakeholder review process. Some steps may be skipped if
performing as a desktop exercise. Two preliminary steps are included for
use in a stakeholder process:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Preview:} Displays a sample of results from the full results
  list so that all stakeholders can take time to become familiar with
  the results table and its functionality.
\item
  \textbf{Review Full Results:} Provides the full results list, so that
  all stakeholders can see all available options before beginning the
  narrowing process.
\end{itemize}

The actual narrowing process (done as a group exercise or by independent
users), consists of the following major steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Option Retention:} The goal of the first step is to hide all
  options that are clearly not viable for the fishery due to failure to
  meet minimum criteria, logistical, political, or other major reasons.
  Users should carefully review the list to hide these options, as well
  as un-hide options that they want to reinstate. Specific instructions
  are included on the screen in this step of the process, including
  questions to consider as narrowing the list (@ref(fig:review-step-1)).
\item
  \textbf{Identification of Top Options:} In this step, users review
  each remaining option to identify a short list of starred options that
  will be seriously considered and explored in more detail. Users should
  familiarize themselves with the sorting feature and the influential
  answer list (see above) to facilitate this process. When comparing
  options, users should compare the number of cautionary caveats and
  criteria, their relative strength, and the ratio of cautionary caveats
  to positive attribute caveats. Specific instructions are included on
  the screen in this step of the process (@ref(fig:review-step-2)).
\item
  \textbf{Critical Evaluation of Top Options:} In the final step, users
  can more critically evaluate the top options by considering each
  criterion and caveat in complete detail, and, potentially, ranking the
  options in order of potential (@ref(fig:review-step-3)). To facilitate
  this process, users can export a report that lists the top options and
  all of their details.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{fishpath-tool-frequently-asked-questions}{%
\chapter{FishPath Tool Frequently Asked
Questions}\label{fishpath-tool-frequently-asked-questions}}

\textbf{How do I submit feedback about content or user experience?}

FishPath benefits from the expertise and feedback of the global
community of FishPath tool users. Users are encouraged to submit
feedback about the FishPath tool, ultimately helping to improve the
tool. There are three ways to submit feedback:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Submit issue on GitHub\\
\item
  The ``Help us improve the FishPath tool'' button on FishPath Tool
  Dashboard. The user is prompted to categorize their feedback as
  ``Content Related'' or ``Software Issue''.
\item
  Email
  \href{mailto:support@fishpath.org}{\nolinkurl{support@fishpath.org}}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{How is my feedback addressed and incorporated?}

The FishPath Tool undergoes periodic updates to ensure that the tool
reflects the latest fisheries science and management information.
User-submitted feedback and suggestions, as well as information from
periodic reviews of the tool, are collated and synthesized by the
FishPath Core Team and addressed and incorporated.

\textbf{How often is the FishPath tool updated?}

Every 6 months.

\textbf{How will I know about updates to the FishPath tool?}

All FishPath users will receive an email every 6 months when updates are
published. Common changes that users may expect are the addition of new
options and questions. When they revisit the FishPath tool, they may
need to answer new questions to see results and they may have new
options in the results.

\textbf{Are answers to new questions also updated in ``copied
fisheries''?}

Once a fishery is copied, changes in the original or copied fishery will
have no effect on the other.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Category}: Basic understanding of the fishery

Market surveys are a mechanism for obtaining fishery-dependent
information. They are useful when fishery information cannot be obtained
on board fishing vessels or at the direct point of offloading, as well
as when fishing occurs at remote or disparate locations that are
difficult to survey consistently. Market surveys may also be useful when
funding or capacity for data-gathering is low, or in situations where
there is not a detailed data-collection protocol. Market surveys may
encompass a variety of techniques, including visual surveys and
interviews, and are intended to gather data on points such as catch
composition and species information. Conducting surveys in fish markets
can often provide access to merchants or fish buyers who are there
purchasing landed fish and transporting catches further along the supply
chain. These merchants often have relationships with fishers, allowing
possible insight into fishery operational characteristics. If the market
is located at or directly near the point of landing, timing and duration
of landings may also be recorded. However, care must be used when
designing a market survey sampling protocol, as catches displayed at
market may not be representative of total catches (by area landed, size
of catch, or gears deployed) and do not include at-sea discards.

When very little is known about a fishery, stakeholders may want to
start by collecting general fishery information or fishery operational
characteristics to gain a basic understanding of it. Where very few
resources are available, this may be the only available data type,
although efforts should be made to move beyond this and make the most
efficient use of available capacity. Information collected can be
fishery independent or dependent; it can help stakeholders learn more
about the size and composition of the fleet, identify the total fished
area, determine the gear types used, identify the species landed, make
broad estimates regarding catch or fishing effort, and gather other
information to aid in better understanding the fishery.

\textbf{Potential Data}

Data that may be collected from this monitoring method include species
identification, species composition, and market supply chain.

\textbf{Examples}

Visual surveys of catch composition. Surveys to obtain information on
sex ratios or length frequencies. Biological samples, including gonads
or otoliths. Seller or distributor interviews.
